    My passion has always lived in two fields: coding programs and
    building communities. Whether it was my work as a developer
    for the University of Tennessee Housing department or it is my
    current occupation as a developer for Malibu Boats, I always
    strive to ensure that I work with groups that build bonds
    between families, friends, or neighbors.
