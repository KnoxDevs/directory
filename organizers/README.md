# Template for Organizers

Below is a template, but there is also a template (above) in this folder you can use to add your name as an organizer to this list. Note that the file must be a YML file. We have chosen `.yml` as the extension, but `.yaml` will work as well. We probably won't accept your pull request if you do that tho ;)

Info we're looking for. You can leave any field but name and group blank if you wish.

- **Name**
- **Group(s)** that you organize
- Online links, website 
- Social links, github, twitter, etc.
- Blurb, capped at 50 words (forreal)

````yaml
name: Insert Name #Leave all fields

group: # This can be singular or an array
