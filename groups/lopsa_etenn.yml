    LOPSA-ETENN is a local chapter of LOPSA-- League of Professional System Administrators. 
    But we're not just limited to sysadmins. We meet monthly to hear from local speakers, 
    and get to know fellow IT workers. You do not have to be a member of LOPSA to come to 
    the meetings, but it is encouraged that you join. We talk about Linux, Windows, network 
    engineering, security, databases, software development, dev/ops --every facet of IT. 
    If you work in IT, you will love it here.
