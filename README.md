# KnoxDevs Directory

This repository contains a collection of `.yml` files that make up the bulk of our website and our soon to be release API for all information about KnoxDevs groups. They are files that contain basic information about each group, blogger, conference, organization, organizer, coworking spot, or event space that gives visitors to the KnoxDevs website and potential future apps, valuable tidbits that hopefully help to strengthen the community.

The structure of this repo is like so:

```
Directory
├── README.md
├── bloggers
|   └── README.md # this is a template and explainer of how to add information to this dataset
├── conferences
├── coworking_spaces
├── event_spaces
├── groups
├── organizations
├── organizers
```

If you would like a photo or logo to accompany your submission (e.g., blogger, group, conference, etc.), head over to the [KnoxDevs Directory Images](https://github.com/KnoxDevs/directory_images) where we are storing logos and photos. There will be a format to the file naming that will be explained there (will match your submission's name).
