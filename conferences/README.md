# Conferences

Do you know of a regional conference / or run a regional conference that you would like to see represented on the KnoxDevs website? There are three primary ways, in descending preference, to get your conference added!

1) Send a Pull Request. (highly recommended!) 

New to pull requests? Here are a couple of tutorials: [from Github](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/), [from Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github), [from Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/learn/github-pull-request-tutorial/). We have a template [below](#template-for-conferences) to get you ready to send a good PR!

2) Submit an issue. 

Has the idea of sending a PR freak you out? Remember that if you're just submtting a PR on 1 file, you might be able to just edit the file here on Github and then propose the PR. Still, if that's too much, submit an issue [above](https://github.com/KnoxDevs/knoxdevs.github.io/issues). We can step you through the change you would like to have made.

3) Get in touch on Slack. 

Has the idea of submitting an issue seem like a massive pain to just update text? Okay. get in touch on [Slack](https://knoxdevs.slack.com/messages/) with one of the many KnoxDevs members. They can help you out... if you ask nicely ;).

## Template for Conferences

Below is a template you can use to add your conference to this list. Note that the file must be a YML file. We have chosen `.yml` as the extension, but `.yaml` will work as well. We probably won't accept your pull request if you do that tho ;)

Info we're looking for. You can leave any field but name and location blank if you wish.

- **Name**
- Description, capped at 50 words (forreal)
- Online links, website and/or twitter
- **Location**

````yaml
